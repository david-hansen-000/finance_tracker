Ok, now let's tidy up the Editor part
add an Edit text up top for personal queries
look at the query to see if rowid is part of the column list, and if no inner joins, then
turn on edit popup/delete, else turn it off
make it more exportable to general database use
maybe show the kinds of column names with types, ie full creation time set up of table

oh, add a dialog of some sort showing that a date entered in receipt data already has an entry
